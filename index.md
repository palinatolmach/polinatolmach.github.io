# About me

I am a PhD candidate in the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://scse.ntu.edu.sg/) at [Nanyang Technological University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/) and [Institute of High Performance Computing](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc), [Agency for Science, Technology and Research](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/). I am advised by [Liu Yang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/) and [Wei Qingsong](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=7mRTEp0AAAAJ&hl=en)

My research interests lie in the domain of software verification and program analysis in application to blockchain and smart contracts in particular. My current research project focuses on formal analysis of composable protocols in the field of decentralized finance (DeFi). My previous work also addressed scalability challenges in private blockchains.

I maintain the [dataset](https://ntu-srslab.github.io/smart-contract-publications/index) of publications on smart contract formal specification and verification.
